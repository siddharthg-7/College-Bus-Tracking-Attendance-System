A production-grade, real-time bus tracking and attendance management system designed for modern educational institutions. The platform automates attendance using real-time ETA calculations powered by advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Features

### Real-Time GPS Tracking
- Live bus location updates via Socket.IO
- Animated bus markers on an interactive Leaflet map
- Low-latency real-time communication between drivers, students, and admins

### ETA-Based Attendance Lock
- Attendance can only be marked if the bus is more than 10 minutes away
- Accurate ETA calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Haversine Distance
- Prevents proxy or late attendance marking

### Role-Based Dashboards
- Student: View bus location, ETA, and mark attendance
- Driver: Share live GPS, manage trip lifecycle, view student list
- Admin: Monitor system, manage routes, buses, and analytics

### Smart Notification System
- FIFO-based notification queue
- Real-time WebSocket alerts and browser notifications
- Event-driven alerts for trip start, delays, and attendance windows

## Data Structures & Algorithms

| Data Structure | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Graph | Adjacency List | Route and stop representation |
| Hash Map | Custom | O(1) lookups for users and sessions |
| Priority Queue | Min Heap | Optimized Dijkstra ETA calculation |
| Queue | FIFO | Notification and event processing |

### Algorithms Used
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (shortest path)
- Haversine Formula (GPS distance)
- Dynamic attendance locking based on ETA

## UI & Design
- Premium dark mode interface
- Glassmorphism effects and smooth transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design
